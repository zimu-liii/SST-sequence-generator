# SST-sequence-generator
Python functions for generating eligible and orthogonal DNA sequences in SST design

SeqFilter.py for generating qualified sequences with GC% in the range of 45% and 55% and no consecutive and identical bases running more than 3;
OrthoFilter.py for ensuring every sequence is orthogonal from each other;
Main.py is the main function.
